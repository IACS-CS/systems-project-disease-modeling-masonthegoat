/* Update this code to simulate a simple disease model! */

/* For this simulation, let's consider a simple disease that spreads through contact.
You can implement a simple model which does one of the following:

1. Model the different effects of different numbers of contacts: in my Handshake Model, two people are in 
   contact each round. What happens if you put three people in contact? Four? Five? Consider different options
   such as always putting people in contact with the people "next" to them (i.e. the people before or after them
   in line) or randomly selecting people to be in contact (just do one of these for your model).

2. Take the "handshake" simulation code as your model, but make it so you can recover from the disease. How does the
spread of the disease change when you set people to recover after a set number of days.

3. Add a "quarantine" percentage to the handshake model: if a person is infected, they have a chance of being quarantined
and not interacting with others in each round.

 * What we are simulating: The base of this project is infection with a 50 percent chance of getting infected when paired up with a sick person. The game lets you select the number of people starting and only one is sick (Patient 0). each round the people are paired up with one other person at random and if you are paired with a sick person you have a 50 percent chance of being infected.
 * 
 * 
 * What elements we have to add: the element i will be added is an incubation period. This will be a number of rounds that a person is infected before they can infect others. This will be a number that is randomly selected between 1 and 5.

are infected. Any other attributes you want to track would have to be added
as properties on your initial individual. 

For example, if you want to track a disease which lasts for a certain number
of rounds (e.g. an incubation period or an infectious period), you would need
to add a property such as daysInfected which tracks how long they've been infected.

Similarily, if you wanted to track immunity, you would need a property that shows
whether people are susceptible or immune (i.e. succeptibility or immunity) */
